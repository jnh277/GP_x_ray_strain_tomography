# A Bayesian Approach to Triaxial Strain Tomography from High-energy X-ray Diffraction

A Gaussian process based approach for the reconstruction of strain from high-energy X-ray strain tomography. This repository contains matlab code to run the simulation example given in the paper available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02158. The code simulates the generation of high-energy X-ray strain images where the sample is rotated about only a single axis.
